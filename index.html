                            Hello, my name is Shauna and I'm an artist. I have been drawing for almost 23 years.
                            I took interest in animation aswell at a very young age. In 2017, I began studying animation
                            in Ballyfermot, Dublin. I studied for 3 years but it was unfortunate that covid made it
                            impossible to keep up with but I was able to pass my studies. During the lockdown 2019, I
                            began
                            to
                            take interest on
                            doing digital work especially around comic-style type, also including the ability to include
                            myself
                            in tv shows.
                        </p>

            <h2 id="commissions">How I do my Art Commissions</h2>

            <div id="overall">

                <p class="how">First, send me a preferred picture of yourself, your family/friends or anyone you know
                    who would love to be drawn in this style or be drawn in movies/tv shows. I will do upa concept
                    design
                    first before going ahead to develop it more.</p>

                <p class="how"> Once you're satisfied with my idea, I will proceed to go ahead and apply the
                    first base with just colour (no details or shading just yet) and ensure you're still happy.
                </p>

                <p class="how"> If still pleased, I will then go on to finalise the finishing product. See below for
                    example.
                    Of course, if any changes are needed that's okay but it will probably cause some time to do so as
                    it takes time.
