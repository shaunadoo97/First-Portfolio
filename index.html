                    Hello, my name is Shauna and I'm an artist. I have been drawing for almost 23 years.
                    I took interest in animation aswell at a very young age. In 2017, I began studying animation
                    in Ballyfermot, Dublin. I studied for 3 years but it was unfortunate that covid made it
                    impossible to keep up with but I was able to pass my studies. During the lockdown 2019, I began to take interest on
                    doing digital work especially around comic-style type, also including the ability to include myself in tv shows. 
                    
                </p>

                <p>
                 When I was a young artist, I would very often do black and white pencil drawings of celebrities.
                 Ed Sheeran was the first celebrtiy for me to draw out on paper! After a while, I got comfortable enough
                 to encourage myself to start using colours. I started including colours to portrait.animals and projects.
